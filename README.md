3D environment for the hotel
Sketch Up 2017 was used for that.

This is the 3D design for inside and outside environment of a hotel. It has a building with hotel 
furniture, swimming pool with furniture and a vehicle parking.
First, the building was designed. For this purpose, rectangle tool, offset tool, line tool, push/pull 
tool were mainly used. First, a rectangle was drawn and it was selected to copied and pasted. Those 
rectangles were placed using move tool and made sizes using scale tool. After that, the lines of 
those rectangles which were required to shape of the building were selected using select tool and 
made as a group them. Then, unselected lines were erased using erase tool. The wall for the 
building was created using offset, push/pull and line tools. And then, using orbit, pan and zoom 
tools, moved on to front of the building and hide the walls for designed inside of the building. 
First, in 1st floor, reception was designed in the right corner. For this purpose, the required shape 
was drawn using line tool and pushed up using push/pull tool. The roof of 1st floor is unhide and a 
rectangle was drawn in left side corner and erased that area. Then the stair which is in left corner 
was created using line, push/pull, move and scale tools. The two tables and two chairs (which are 
nearest reception.) which are in 1st floor were created using circle tool, push/pull tool, line tool, 
move and scale tools. Then unhide the walls of 1st floor and front floor was made as glass floor 
using offset, line, push/pull and especially paint bucket to textured as glass. As well as the door 
was created. The entrance floor was created using rectangle, circle tools, line, move, scale, 
push/pull and offset tools as well. The entrance floor is used to separate the parking and inside 
hotel. The front wall of 2nd floor was erased and the balcony was created using line, offset, 
push/pull, paint, scale tools and the balcony can be reached from right side corner of the glass wall. 
And the windows were created using line, rectangle, offset, push/pull, scale, move and paint bucket 
(glass texture) tools. 
Move to the back side of the background and the rectangle for area of the hotel environment was 
drawn. And it was little bit pushed to up and designed the outside of the hotel. First, the pool was 
created using rectangle, offset, push/pull, scale and paint bucket tools. In here, water was shown 
using water texture. The flower pots were created using circle, offset, push/pull and move tools. 
The small tables which were nearest pool chairs were created using circle, push/pull, scale and 
move tools. The wall with gate was created using line, offset, push/pull, scale, paint bucket tools. 
Here, orbit tool, pan tool and zoom tool were used to move to relevant places easily. As well as, 
select tool was used to select the relevant objects. The paint bucket tool was used to apply relevant 
texture to objects. And 3D text tool was used for add text and scale tool was used for resized and 
them and using move tool placed them.
And here, some components were inserted from 3D warehouse of SketchUp. They are, dining table 
for 2nd floor, table chair for 1st floor, a man, bulbs, pool chair, picnic table, flower vase in 2nd floor, 
juice glass, car and trees. Their sizes were adjusted using scale tool and placed them to relevant 
places using move tool.
